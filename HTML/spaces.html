    This project began with doom scrolling. In the past few years Youtube and Instagram have introduced functionality similar to TikTok, and endless stream of short form videos. To keep viewers engaged, Social Media companies have developed advanced “algorithms” that recommend similar content, based on what you like, share, and view. I consciously avoided TikTok, knowing that I am susceptible to addictive behavior, however with the introduction of what is essentially TikTok into other platforms, I still end up watching hours of content. Through this installation, I attempted to create a meditation on our interaction with virtual spaces,  highlighting the feedback loops of social media through a series of audio feedback loops created by interaction by the viewer and live video feedback blended with footage screen recorded from people’s social media feeds.
