# Documentation

I was in a group with Marc and Kayla. We all made our own paragraphs of text. We delegated what assets were to be called by who. Marc called the image, Kayla called the audio and I called the CSS. Everything except the css went smoothly. I tried to use a random CSS file from the internet, but that didn't work so we ended up using a modified version of Rachel's file.

The hardest part of all this  was using github properly. We mostly managed to not screw up each others text, but I accidentally tried to merge something with an error, and then saved both the merge in the original, so everything was duplicated. I ended up deleting the wrong half from the main branch, but that was easily undone.

I ended up just switching somethings up in the CSS file, and adding divs throughout the website just to make it a little clearer

I think we all communicated well and troubleshot things well. When I screwed up Kayla's code during the merge issue, we worked together to fix it.
